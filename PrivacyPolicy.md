# Privacy Policy version 2.0 for the MathPrac iOS app

**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

## Data Collection

The MathPrac iOS app does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. The app does not require user accounts, and no user data is stored on our servers.

## Network Communication

The app communicates with the Groq API (https://api.groq.com) to generate math problems and process feedback. The following information is sent to Groq's servers:
- Selected competition type (e.g., AMC 8, AMC 10, AIME)
- Selected topic categories (e.g., Algebra, Geometry)
- Difficulty level (1-10)
- User-submitted answers (for validation purposes only)
- Optional feedback and comments submitted by users

This data is transmitted solely for the purpose of generating math problems and improving problem quality. No personally identifiable information is included in these requests.

## Third-Party Services

This app uses the Groq API for AI-powered math problem generation. Please refer to Groq's privacy policy at https://groq.com/privacy-policy/ for information about how they handle data.

## Data Retention

The app does not retain any user data locally beyond the current session. When you close the app, all problem history and answers are cleared (except for the streak counter, which is stored locally on your device only).

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is designed for educational purposes and does not require any personal information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the version number and last updated date at the top of this document.
